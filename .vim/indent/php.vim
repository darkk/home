" Vim indent file
" Language:	PHP
" Author:	John Wellesz <John.wellesz (AT) teaser (DOT) fr>
" URL:		http://www.2072productions.com/vim/indent/php.vim
" Last Change: 2005 June 30th
" Version: 1.17
"
"
" Changes: 1.17		- Now following parts of split lines are indented:
"						Instead of:
"							$foo=
"							"foo"
"							."foo";
"							
"						You have:
"							$foo=
"								"foo"
"								."foo";
"		
"					- If a "case : break;" was declared on a single line, the
"					  following "case" was not indented correctly.
"					- If a </script> html tag was preceded by a "?>" it wasn't indented.
"					- Some other minor corrections and improvements.
"
"
" Changes: 1.16		- Now starting and ending '*' of multiline '/* */' comments are aligned
"					  on the '*' of the '/*' comment starter.
"					- Some code improvements that make indentation faster.
"
" Changes: 1.15		- Corrected some problems with the indentation of
"					  multiline "array()" declarations.
"
" Changes: 1.14		- Added auto-formatting for comments (using the Vim option formatoptions=qroc).
"					- Added the script option PHP_BracesAtCodeLevel to
"					  indent the '{' and '}' at the same level than the
"					  code they contain.
" 
" Changes: 1.13		- Some code cleaning and typo corrections (Thanks to
"					  Emanuele Giaquinta for his patches)
"
" Changes: 1.12		- The bug involving searchpair() and utf-8 encoding in Vim 6.3 will
"					  not make this script to hang but you'll have to be
"					  careful to not write '/* */' comments with other '/*'
"					  inside the comments else the indentation won't be correct.
"					  NOTE: This is true only if you are using utf-8 and vim 6.3.
"
" Changes: 1.11		- If the "case" of a "switch" wasn't alone on its line
"					  and if the "switch" was at col 0 (or at default indenting)
"					  the lines following the "case" were not indented.
"
" Changes: 1.10		- Lines beginning by a single or double quote were
"					  not indented in some cases.
"
" Changes: 1.09		- JavaScript code was not always directly indented.
"
" Changes: 1.08		- End comment tags '*/' are indented like start tags '/*'.
"					- When typing a multiline comment, '}' are indented
"					  according to other commented '{'.
"					- Added a new option 'PHP_removeCRwhenUnix' to
"					  automatically remove CR at end of lines when the file
"					  format is Unix.
"					- Changed the file format of this very file to Unix.
"					- This version seems to correct several issues some people
"					  had with 1.07.
"
" Changes: 1.07		- Added support for "Here document" tags:
"					   - HereDoc end tags are indented properly.
"					   - HereDoc content remains unchanged.
"					- All the code that is outside PHP delimiters remains
"					  unchanged.
"					- New feature: The content of <script.*> html tags is considered as PHP
"					  and indented according to the surrounding PHP code.
"					- "else if" are detected as "elseif".
"					- Multiline /**/ are indented when the user types it but
"					  remain unchanged when indenting from their beginning.
"					- Fixed indenting of // and # comments.
"					- php_sync_method option is set to 0 (fromstart).
"					  This is required for complex PHP scripts else the indent
"					  may fail.
"					- Files with non PHP code at the beginning could alter the indent
"					  of the following PHP code.
"					- Other minor improvements and corrections.
"
" Changes: 1.06:    - Switch block were no longer indented correctly...
"					- Added an option to use a default indenting instead of 0.
"					  (whereas I still can't find any good reason to use it!)
"					- A problem with ^\s*);\= lines where ending a non '{}'
"					  structure.
"					- Changed script local variable to be buffer local
"					  variable instead.
"
" Changes: 1.05:    - Lines containing "<?php ?>" and "?> <?php"
"					  (start and end tag on the same line) are no
"					  longer indented at col 1 but as normal code.
"
" Changes: 1.04:	- Strings containing "//" could break the indenting
"					  algorithm.
"					- When a '{}' block was at col 1, the second line of the
"					  block was not indented at all (because of a stupid
"					  optimization coupled with a bug).
"
" Changes: 1.03:	- Some indenting problems corrected: end of non '{}'
"					  structures was not detected in some cases. The part of
"					  code concerned have been re-written
"					- PHP start tags were not indented at col 1
"					- Wrong comment in the code have been corrected
"
" Changes: 1.02:	- The bug I was talking about in version 1.01 (right below) has
"					  been corrected :)
"					- Also corrected another bug that could occur in
"					  some special cases.
"					- I removed the debug mode left in 1.01 that could
"					  cause some Vim messages at loading if other script were
"					  bugged.
"
" Changes: 1.01:	- Some little bug corrections reguarding automatic optimized
"					  mode that missed some tests and could break the indenting.
"					- There is also a problem with complex non bracked structures, when several
"					  else are following each other, the algorithm do not indent the way it
"					  should.
"					  That will be corrected in the next version.
" 
"  If you find a bug, please e-mail me at John.wellesz (AT) teaser (DOT) fr
"  with an example of code that break the algorithm.

"
"	Thanks a lot for using this script.
"

" NOTE: This script must be used with PHP syntax ON and with the php syntax
"		script by Lutz Eymers (http://www.isp.de/data/php.vim ) that's the script bundled with Gvim.
"
"
"	In the case you have syntax errors in your script such as end of HereDoc
"	tags not at col 1 you'll have to indent your file 2 times (This script 
"	will automatically put HereDoc end tags at col 1).
" 

" NOTE: If you are editing file in Unix file format and that (by accident)
" there are '\r' before new lines, this script won't be able to proceed
" correctly and will make many mistakes because it won't be able to match
" '\s*$' correctly.
" So you have to remove those useless characters first with a command like:
"
" :%s /\r$//g
"
" or simply 'let' the option PHP_removeCRwhenUnix to 1 and the script will
" silently remove them when VIM load this script (at each bufread).

" Options: PHP_default_indenting = # of sw (default is 0), # of sw will be
"		   added to the indent of each line of PHP code.
"
" Options: PHP_removeCRwhenUnix = 1 to make the script automatically remove CR
"		   at end of lines (by default this option is unset), NOTE that you
"		   MUST remove CR when the fileformat is UNIX else the indentation
"		   won't be correct...
"
" Options: PHP_BracesAtCodeLevel = 1 to indent the '{' and '}' at the same
"		   level than the code they contain.
"		   Exemple:
"			Instead of:
"				if ($foo)
"				{
"					foo();
"				}
"
"			You will write:
"				if ($foo)
"					{
"					foo();
"					}
"
"			NOTE: The script will be a bit slower if you use this option because
"			some optimizations won't be available.


" The 4 following lines prevent this script from being loaded several times per buffer.
" They also prevent the load of different indent scripts for PHP at the same time.

endif
let b:did_indent = 1

"	This script set the option php_sync_method of PHP syntax script to 0
"	(fromstart indenting method) in order to have an accurate syntax.
"	If you are using very big PHP files (which is a bad idea) you will
"	experience slowings down while editing, if your code contains only PHP
"	code you can comment the line below.
