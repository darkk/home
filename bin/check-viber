# Sometimes Viber deadlocks leaving the process alive without any windows. It's
# quite annoying as `program has crashed` apport message is not displayed in
# this case. Here is cron watchdog to workaroung the issue.
#
# Add something something like this to user's crontab:
#
#   1-59/5 * * * * env.session check-viber
#
# This script is in public domain.
